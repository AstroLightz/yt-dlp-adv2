### ADD
- Config file to store options, and allow the user to bring up a menu to change them
- Filename Format: [item #] - %uploader% - %title%
    - Download logic must be changed to make this possible. I.E instead of extracting all URLS from a playlist URL,
    pass the playlist URL and use 'playlist_index'. Requires rework of download status too.


### FIX
- Support playlists for video quality


### CHANGE
- Clean up README and add a logo
- Improve download status. Maybe utilize yt-dlp's custom download status?
- Improve Action messages (Override them with a complete/fail message when done)
- For Videos, get video quality before confirmation screen


### FEATURE BRANCH
- Clean up unused/redundant code
- Change display to make it more clear when yt-dlp is doing post-processing.
Currently, it replaces the download/total bytes with its post-processing bytes, which leads to confusion with
download complete size.
