### ADD
- Add flag to bypass default video quality
- Add filename formats for Playlist Directory names
- Overhaul filename format by allowing users to create their own formats through pre-defined options
    - Allow making their own filename formats default by saving to the config
    - Possibly make this an option for Playlist Directory names
    - Would be a menu-driven process, similar to the Config Editor


### FIX
- Support playlists for video quality


### CHANGE
- Clean up README and add a logo
- Improve Download status for Artwork. Show a Download status for total download since individual status is not available
